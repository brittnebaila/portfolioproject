        <h1>HTML5 AND CSS DESIGN</h1>
        
        <div class="row">
               <div class="column">
        <a href="http://brittnedanielle.com/bts189/project1/project1.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <img src="pantonehologramconcept.png" alt="portfolio" width="300px"></a>
        <p>As a visual design student, building my portfolio is a contant process. This project challenged me to write an about me and think about my goals as I move into a professional career.</p>

                   </div>        
    <div class="column">
        <a href=http://brittnedanielle.com/bts189/cssproject2/project2.html  target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="oj.png" alt="orangejuice" width="300px" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a>
        <p>This was the first page that I deployed to my own web server. I chose a simple color palette but still loud. I wanted the reader to know this juice really comes across as orange so I utilized the color scheme to say that. My pet peeve is when searching for a recipe and there are ten paragraphs I have to scroll through to get to the recipe so this is my ode to mininal recipe cards</p>
        </div>

            <div class="column">
                <a href="http://brittnedanielle.com/bts189/favoritecity/project3.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <img src="city.png" alt="sydneyau" width="300px"></a>
            <p>Inspired by the background image, I chose a color palette that didn't take away from the image and instead incorporated it into the page design. The clock and weather were designed so the user can visualize being in Sydney, along with a simple map of the districts. As the user is reading the page interesting facts are visually highlighted, giving the user an interactive experience with the web page.</p>

     <img src="blackbar.png" alt="blackbar" width="100%">   
        
                <div class="row">
                                <div class="column">
            <a href="http://brittnedanielle.com/bts189/phish/multimedia.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <img src="phish.png" alt="phish" width="300px"></a>
        <p>I couldn't resist making a page on songs by a favorite band of mine as soon as I had the chance. This project taught me how to embed video and audio into my html code. I wanted to keep the layout of the page simple, but show off the funky side of the band with the color choice. </p>
                   </div> 
    <div class="column">
        <a href="http://brittnedanielle.com/bts189/burger/hamburger.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <img src="burgers.png" alt="burgers" width="300px"></a>
        <p>What better way to keep my attention while learning CSS than to incorporate food? I learned how to manipulate size, shape, and color of divisions. Having a visual picture as to what was happening while I manipulated the code was an important foundation for understanding how CSS works.</p>
        </div>

            <div class="column">
                <a href="http://brittnedanielle.com/bts189/forms/planted.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="forms.png" alt="forms" width="300px"></a>
            <p>While trying to layout my form, things were not clicking for me initially on this assignment. The form was functioning but the layout of my page was distracting and the margins were off. I redid the layout and now there are no distractions and the formatting works with the image.</p>
